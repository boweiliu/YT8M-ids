## What's in here?

This repo contains a [list of all of the video
IDs](https://github.com/jmhessel/YT8M-ids/blob/master/training_ids.zip)
in the [Youtube8M](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/) training set,
along with the scripts used to produce this list.

Note: the scripts are not clean, nor are they robust. However, I do
think they work.

## How do I run things in this repo?

If you're here, you're probably just looking for the list of
[Youtube8M
IDs](https://github.com/jmhessel/YT8M-ids/blob/master/training_ids.zip).
If you really wanted to re-download everything, you would run

```
python download_ids.py
```
